[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/appdirect/chatty-pie-connector/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/appdirect/chatty-pie-connector)

A minimal example of a connector using the service-integration SDK

## Requirements
* Java 8
* Docker
* A mysql instance running at `localhost:3306` with username `root` and a blank password

## Running the application
### In the IDE
* run `ChattyPieConnectorApplication`

### On the command-line
* `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

This starts the connector application's http server and exposes the main
endpoint `localhost:8080/api/v1/integration/processEvent` which a marketplace
can send event notifications to.

### Changing the default port
* By default, it starts on port `8080`.
* To override, add the `-Dserver.port=XXXX` jvm arg

### Starting dependencies locally
By default the application is expecting a MySQL instance to be running
at `localhost:3306` and a smtp server running on `localhost:3025`.
If you do not have both, we offer a docker compose file at the root. Run it with

    docker-compose up

## Accessing the app

To verify that the server is running correctly, check if a GET request at the `/health`
endpoint of a running CPC instance. For example, if the connector were deployed at [https://example.com]() the health 
endpoint would be [https://example.com/health]() and it would be expected to return returns 200(OK) if the server is
up and running.

## Adding a new field to the database
Let's say you want to add a new column to the `company_account` table and expose it as a field in the `CompanyAccount` bean.
Let's walk through the process required for that.

### Create Flyway migration
* Add `.sql` migration file in `src/main/resources/db.migration/`: this new file should contain the addition of your new column.
* Run the migrations against your local db. To do this, start the app - `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.

### Regenerate the beans
* Classes such as `CompanyAccount` and `ChatroomCreationRecord` are beans generated by [`QueryDSL`](http://www.querydsl.com/) based on your database tables.
* When making table changes, you need to regenerate the beans so they reflect the new table state.
* Regenerate the beans with: `mvn clean generate-sources -DskipDbCodeGeneration=false`
    * This assumes a default db at localhost:3306 with username `root` and a blank password.
    * Optional params available to override those defaults are:
        * `-Dmodel.source.db.username=[your-local-db-user]`
        * `-Dmodel.source.db.password=[your-local-db-password]`
        * `-Dmodel.source.db.url=[connection-string-for-your-db-here]`
* The updated sources will be regenerated in `src/main/java/com/chattypie/persistence/model`
* Commit the updated files like any other sources.
* Note: keep in mind this entire package is autogenerated, so do not edit any code in it: your changes will be overridden the next time someone regenerates the beans.

## Dependencies version update
Using the [`versions` maven plugin](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/), you can keep
your dependencies & maven plugins up-to-date. Most of those commands directly modify your `pom.xml`.
* update the `spring-boot` parent version: `./mvnw versions:update-parent`
* update all dependencies: `./mvnw versions:use-latest-releases`
    * Warning: this might take a long time to complete
* display available maven plugin updates `./mvnw versions:display-plugin-updates`
    * If newer versions are available, you will need to manually update `pom.xml`.
